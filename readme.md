## About

For the moment, there's only one plugin: `psychopy_gratingstim`.

### GratingStim plugin (`psychopy_gratingstim`)

The [GratingStim](http://www.psychopy.org/api/visual/gratingstim.html) is a visual stimulus from PsychoPy, a Python library for psychology.

With this plugin, you can use the GratingStim easily within OpenSesame, a graphical experiment builder for the social sciences. You can use the plugin in OpenSesame [coroutines](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.1/manual/structure/coroutines/), and adjust its properties periodically; this allows you, for example, to implement a drifting gabor patch.
